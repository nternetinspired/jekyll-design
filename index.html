<p class="intro">This is a rapid prototyping and comping tool built with <a href="//jekyllrb.com">
    Jekyll</a> by <a href="//twitter.com/nternetinspired">Seth Warburton</a> to
    enable (his own) rapid in-browser design, from wireframes and mockups right through to
    hi-fidelity html.</p>
    <p>Nice.</p>

<h2>Sassy Styles</h2>
<p>It also includes neato design tools like my <a href="//sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>
    interpretation of <a href="//twitter.com/samanthatoy">
    Samanth Warren</a>'s <a href="//styletil.es/">Style Tiles</a> and some other patterns that
    allow you to quickly create color pallettes using Sass' built-in colour functions.
    It also includes a customised version of my own Sass framework,
    <a href="//github.com/nternetinspired/oneweb-sass/tree/master">oneweb-sass</a>. Of course,
    it's super-simple to rip out my Sass and replace it with your own. Whatever floats
    your boat.</p>

<p>For more information on Style tiles I recommend reading this excellent ALA article;
    <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/style-tiles-and-how-they-work">Style Tiles
    and How They Work</a> by their creator.</p>

<p>You can find the source code for it at: <a href="//github.com/nternetinspired">Github</a>.</p>
