<p class="intro">This is a work-in-progress attempt to create a rapid prototyping
    and comping tool with <a href="//jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. Made by
    <a href="//twitter.com/nternetinspired">Seth Warburton</a> to enable (his own)
    rapid in-browser design, from wireframes and hi-fidelity mockups right through to
    production html and css. Nice.</p>

<p>
    Crucially, it allows me to present the design direction of <em>specific</em> site
    elements without the surrounding context, and distraction, of ‘a web design’.
    Hopefully this will…

    and provide a catalyst for discussions around the preferences and goals of
    the client.

<h2>Mmmmm Sassy</h2>
<p>It includes some neat things like my <a href="//sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>
    interpretation of <a href="//twitter.com/samanthatoy">
    Samantha Warren</a>'s <a href="//styletil.es/">Style Tiles</a>, Element Collages
    inspired by an article from Dan Mall <a href="http://danielmall.com/articles/rif-element-collages/">
    http://danielmall.com/articles/rif-element-collages/</a>, which I was turned
    on to by <a href="https://twitter.com/_cdja">Chris Allwood</a> ,
    and some other patterns that allow you to quickly get past the fundamentals of
    a site design. It also includes a customised version of my own Sass framework,
    <a href="//github.com/nternetinspired/oneweb-sass/tree/master">oneweb-sass</a>
    though it's super-simple to rip out my Sass and replace it with your own.
    Whatever floats your boat.</p>

<p>Items of note:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fully awesomised Jekyll.</li>
    <li>Github pages friendly. Clone > tweak > push > view.</li>
    <li>A re-usable modular code-base.</li>
    <li>YAML content; set once, use everywhere.</li>
    <li>Style tiles.</li>
    <li>Sassy colour manipulation tools.</li>
    <li>A typography test page.</li>
    <li>oneweb sass.</li>
    <li>Minified html output (optional).</li>
</ul>
