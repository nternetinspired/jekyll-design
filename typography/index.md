title: Good typography matters ™

I frequently found myself writing a load of wacky type, oftent within a CMS
WYSIWYG editor, simply to visualise the typographic styles I was setting in a
live environment. That shit gets real tiresome real quick, so I made this thing.

In a professional context it often happens that private or corporate clients
corder a publication to be made and presented with the actual content still not
being ready. Think of a news blog that’s filled with content hourly on the day
of going live. However, reviewers tend to be distracted by comprehensible content,
say, a random text copied from a newspaper or the internet. The are likely to
focus on the text, disregarding the layout and its elements. Lorem ipsum and its many variants have been employed since the early
‘60s, and quite likely since the sixteenth century.

## Rules

<hr/>

Check it out, horizontal rules. These need special treatment if they aren’t
going to fubar your baseline.

<hr/>

## Phrase elements

When I speak to people I don’t know, I frequently place a **strong**, and often
random, *emphasis* on certain words to creep them out.

If they are old enough to have have used dial-up modems I use **b tags** or,
almost certainly random, *i tags* instead. That’s how I roll.

## Quotes

This is a paragraph with an “awesome inline quote using q tags”, the of type
which I’d all but forgotten about. Does anyone use those?

> I found myself writing a selection of wacky type, usually within a CMS editor
in my case, in order to visualise the typographic styles I was setting in a live
environment. That shit gets boring eventually, so I decided to do this thing
instead.

And for the really fancy stuff:

> Sometimes, I go nuts and to put paragraph tags inside the blockquotes!
>
> Because sometimes you need more than one paragraph inside a blockquote.
Not often mind.

And, as long as it’s something I’m willing to admit to, I’ll go as far as citing
the quote with cite tags, thusly:

> I frequently surprise myself with the ease at which I can type random shit!
>
> <cite>I said that, right here.</cite>

## Code

If I want demo my l33t haxx0r skillz I’ll

    Serve you my code inside pre tags

Or even: `Lovely, semantic code tags!`

If I’m feeling particularly retro, I might define the following as keyboard
input (chuckle) using kbd tags: <kbd>\(ma\)h this cod3z in br0. M@d skillz.
Beep.</kbd>

### Gists

I’m going to randomly embed a Gist here (using Jekyll's syntax), because people
sometimes do that. Deal with it.

{% gist 9409514 %}

## Other things

If there are things I don’t really want, or expect, you to read like all that
legal junk <small>I’ll hide all that inside small tags, so you know it isn’t
really important</small>, because I <strike>don’t give a shit</strike> details
matter.

<mark>I might use mark tags to make things ugly.</mark>

For definitions it’s best to use the dfn tag, thusly:

<dfn>Moron (mo·ron) - A person who’d write a whole page of this crap in order
to check their typographical basics.</dfn>
